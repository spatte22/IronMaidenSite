<h3>THE STORY OF TROOPER</h3>
<p>"Real ale fan and history aficionado Bruce Dickinson, Maiden's vocalist, played a major role in developing the unique flavour of the beer, entailing ongoing visits to Robinson’s brewery in Stockport.</p>
<p>"I'm a lifelong fan of traditional English ale; I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when we were asked to create our own beer. I have to say that I was very nervous: Robinsons are the only people I have had to audition for in 30 years. Their magic has been to create the alchemical wedding of flavour and texture that is TROOPER. I love it."</p>
 <h3>ABOUT THE BREWER</h3>
<p>Combining an impressive heritage, stretching from 1838, with innovation, Robinsons is one the UK’s largest family brewers, with 340 pubs across the North West and Wales. Our pubs are an integral part of the Robinsons family and the way customers enjoy our ales.<img src="../images/Iron-Maiden-Robinsons-Trooper-Beer-Ultimate-Set-_1.jpg" class="rightpic" alt="Trooper Beer ultimate set"></p>
<p>2013 is an exciting time for Robinsons as we proudly celebrate 175 years of brewing excellence and heritage. Our massive investment into the brewery brings 'cutting edge' technology. With our state of the art brew house kicking out some seriously tasty ales, and our 2013 limited edition ales already proving popular, our 175th anniversary promises to be a great year for quality handcrafted ales and our customers who drink them."</p><i>From <a href="http://www.ironmaidenbeer.com/about">ironmaidenbeer.com</a><br />Visit the website to buy and sell Iron Maiden beer!</i>
